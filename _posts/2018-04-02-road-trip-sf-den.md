<!-- TODO:
    - add duration of travel for each day, and a breakdown of hours per day so that everyone has an estimate of how much time they should Suspendisse
    - add map at the top of each post for the route of that day5
    - add your own or other people 360 photos and/or videos
    - add links to products in packing list, and explain why they might need it
    - do i want to put several posts for different days or all in one? if someone wants to get a full list of what to do in each place, if you divide the place into several days it's gonna be difficult for that person to get a whole idea of what to do in the area, because you're gonna force him to look around your posts and collect the information himself

## Tips & advice {#tipsandadvice}
***
- Check the _national parks app_ by Rei
- Check freecampsites.net for dispersed (wild camping) free camping
- Get national parks pass if you intend to visit multiple parks. Valid for a year, transferable to someone else
- Check opening dates for all parks, routes or monuments. Also check usual weather conditions for that time of the year, as it might not be worth it if it’s too cold/rainy
- Eat at any of the multiple In-n-out restaurants (it’s like McDonalds but much better and cheaper. It’s an american classic)
- If I indicate a place with a combination of numbers and letters like 857CX23X+RX is because it’s a plus code, which can be used in google maps to search a specific location that doesn’t necessarily have a regular address
