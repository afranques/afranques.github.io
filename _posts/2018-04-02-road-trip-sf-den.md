## Tips & Advice {#tipsandadvice}
***
- Check the _national parks app_ by Rei
- Check freecampsites.net for dispersed (wild camping) free camping
- Get national parks pass if you intend to visit multiple parks. Valid for a year, transferable to someone else
- Check opening dates for all parks, routes or monuments. Also check usual weather conditions for that time of the year, as it might not be worth it if it’s too cold/rainy
- Eat at any of the multiple In-n-out restaurants (it’s like McDonalds but much better and cheaper. It’s an american classic)
- If I indicate a place with a combination of numbers and letters like 857CX23X+RX is because it’s a plus code, which can be used in google maps to search a specific location that doesn’t necessarily have a regular address
