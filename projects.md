- [**Status of the Voyager project**](/docs/space-technology-essay-antonio.pdf) - Essay submitted to Space Technology I (TTT4234) during my semester at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. The essay firstly provides the necessary background knowledge about the Voyager project, as it's considered that's the proper way to understand what are the physical limitations or constraints that are defining and will define the possibilities of their missions. And next, it summarizes what are the current and future studies carried out by both probes that constitute the Voyager project; the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2.

- [**WLAN Security Analysis and Construction**](/docs/ttm4137-lab-report.pdf) - Lab [description](/docs/ttm4137-lab-description.pdf) and [report](/docs/ttm4137-lab-report.pdf) submitted to Wireless Network Security (TTM4137) during my semester at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. Awarded as the best lab report in class (Fall 2014). Together with my other two labmates, we explored many of the protocols and mechanisms proposed in the IEEE 802.11 standard to provide security for wireless local area networks (WLANs). We performed a security analysis and assessment of WLANs already running, and configured, secured and deployed new ones ourselves. As a result, we got a better understanding of the weaknesses, strengths of these security mechanisms, and the challenges of WLAN security management. 

- [**WPS: A user configuration facility that became a threat**](/docs/ttm4137-essay-antonio.pdf) - Essay submitted to Wireless Network Security (TTM4137) during my semester at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. The essay firstly provides the necessary background knowledge about the Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS), then it focuses on why it became a security threat and how does a brute-force attack take advantage of it. Finally, it briefly describes what safety measures can be carried out for preventing this attack.
