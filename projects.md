### 2016
- [**Quovis**](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}/quovis) - Android application for quickly saving, organizing and retrieving your favorite locations.

### 2010
- [**Setting up PHP, MySQL, WordPress and Exchange on Windows Server 2003**](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}/documentation-windows-server-2003/blob/master/php_mysql_wordpress_exchange_on_windows_server_2003.pdf) - Documentation (in Spanish) showing all the necessary steps to:
1. Set up a blog site with WordPress on our own Windows Server 2003. The documentation also shows how to install PHP over IIS and MySQL.
2. Install Exchange Server 2003 in order for the users of our (made-up) company domain to be able to send/receive (and recover in case of accidental deletions) emails.


## Class projects
---

### 2015
- [**CMat: describing the language and its Python-implemented interpreter**](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}/scripting-languages/tree/master/term_project) - Term project submitted to Design and Implementation of Scripting Languages (CS 598-DHP) at UIUC (Fall 2015). It implements an interpreter in Python for CMat; a blended subset of Matlab, C and Cool.

- [**Numerical methods for nonlinear modeling**](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}/undergraduate-thesis#undergraduate-thesis) - Undergraduate thesis submitted for my B.S. in Telecommunications Engineering at UPV (submitted and presented in July 2015). For abstract and full dissertation check [this repository](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}/undergraduate-thesis#undergraduate-thesis).

### 2014
- [**Status of the Voyager project**](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}/space-technology-i/blob/master/essay/space_technology_essay_antonio.pdf) - Essay submitted to Space Technology I (TTT4234) during my semester at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (Fall 2014). The essay firstly provides the necessary background knowledge about the Voyager project, as it's considered that's the proper way to understand what are the physical limitations or constraints that are defining and will define the possibilities of their missions. And next, it summarizes what are the current and future studies carried out by both probes that constitute the Voyager project; the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2.

- [**WLAN Security Analysis and Construction**](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}/wireless-network-security/blob/master/lab_report/ttm4137_lab_report.pdf) - Lab [description](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}/wireless-network-security/blob/master/lab_report/ttm4137_lab_description.pdf) and [report](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}/wireless-network-security/blob/master/lab_report/ttm4137_lab_report.pdf) submitted to Wireless Network Security (TTM4137) during my semester at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (Fall 2014). Awarded as the best lab report in class. Together with my other two labmates, we explored many of the protocols and mechanisms proposed in the IEEE 802.11 standard to provide security for wireless local area networks (WLANs). We performed a security analysis and assessment of WLANs already running, and configured, secured and deployed new ones ourselves. As a result, we got a better understanding of the weaknesses, strengths of these security mechanisms, and the challenges of WLAN security management. 

- [**WPS: A user configuration facility that became a threat**](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}/wireless-network-security/blob/master/essay/ttm4137_essay.pdf) - Essay submitted to Wireless Network Security (TTM4137) during my semester at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (Fall 2014). The essay firstly provides the necessary background knowledge about the Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS), then it focuses on why it became a security threat and how does a brute-force attack take advantage of it. Finally, it briefly describes what safety measures can be carried out for preventing this attack.

### 2013
- [**Multi threaded instant messaging application in Java**](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}/telematics-services-design/tree/master/chat) - Project submitted to Telematics Services Design at UPV (Fall 2013). The application is capable of sending and receiving messages between two machines across the network, as well as performing file transfers.

- [**Programmable Digital Systems**](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}/programmable-digital-systems) - Set of laboratory projects submitted to Programmable Digital Systems at UPV (Spring 2013), written in Verilog an implemented in an Altera DE2 Board (which includes an Altera 90nm Cyclone II FPGA). The design software used was Altera Quartus II.

- [**Mastermind in 68000 Assembly language with EASy68K**](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}/microprocessors-based-systems/tree/master/mastermind) - Together with my labmate, we implemented a version of the classic [Mastermind game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) in [68000 Assembly](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/68000_Assembly) (the assembly language for the Motorola 68K-series microprocessors), and assembled/simulated it with [EASy68K](http://www.easy68k.com/).

### 2010
- [**Mercat Catala**](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}/mercat-catala) - Set of scripts for parsing, saving (web scraping) and uploading to a personally-owned database all the cultural events listed in the [Catalan Government's website](http://agenda.cultura.gencat.cat/). Also, once we have all that data, use it in a social network style website (intended to be named **mercatcatala.cat**) for editing, commenting, liking/disliking, etc. the events among the website users. The project was submitted as an ending to a set of technical courses that occur in Spain between High School and College.

### 2008
- [**Slot Machine**](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}/slot-machine) - Basic game in Javascript emulating a slot machine. Used as a way to learn the very basics of Javascript during a set of technical courses that occur in Spain between High School and College.
