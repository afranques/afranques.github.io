subtitle: This is a collection of some of my personal and class projects. Although some might be better/bigger than others, the main purpose they serve is for me to learn, practice, test or play with all those things that interest me or I am feeling curious at some point in time. A more updated list of them can also be found on my <a href="https://github.com/afranques44">Github</a>.

## Personal projects

### 2016
- **Quovis** - (to be filled) Android App for saving, organizing and retrieving your favorite locations.


### 2010
- [**Mercat Catala**](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}/mercat-catala) - Set of scripts for parsing, saving and uploading to a personally-owned database all the cultural events listed in the [Catalan Government's website](http://agenda.cultura.gencat.cat/). Also, once we have all that data, use it in a social network style website (intended to be named **mercatcatala.cat**) for editing, commenting, liking/disliking, etc. the events among the website users.

- [**Setting up PHP, MySQL, WordPress and Exchange on Windows Server 2003**](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}/documentation-windows-server-2003/blob/master/php_mysql_wordpress_exchange_on_windows_server_2003.pdf) - Documentation (in Spanish) showing all the necessary steps to:
1. Set up a blog site with WordPress on our own Windows Server 2003. The documentation also shows how to install PHP over IIS and MySQL.
2. Install Exchange Server 2003 in order for the users of our (made-up) company domain to be able to send/receive (and recover in case of accidental deletions) emails.

### 2014
- [**Status of the Voyager project**](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}/space-technology-i/blob/master/essay/space_technology_essay_antonio.pdf) - Essay submitted to Space Technology I (TTT4234) during my semester at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. The essay firstly provides the necessary background knowledge about the Voyager project, as it's considered that's the proper way to understand what are the physical limitations or constraints that are defining and will define the possibilities of their missions. And next, it summarizes what are the current and future studies carried out by both probes that constitute the Voyager project; the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2.

- [**WLAN Security Analysis and Construction**](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}/wireless-network-security/blob/master/lab_report/ttm4137_lab_report.pdf) - Lab [description](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}/wireless-network-security/blob/master/lab_report/ttm4137_lab_description.pdf) and [report](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}/wireless-network-security/blob/master/lab_report/ttm4137_lab_report.pdf) submitted to Wireless Network Security (TTM4137) during my semester at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. Awarded as the best lab report in class (Fall 2014). Together with my other two labmates, we explored many of the protocols and mechanisms proposed in the IEEE 802.11 standard to provide security for wireless local area networks (WLANs). We performed a security analysis and assessment of WLANs already running, and configured, secured and deployed new ones ourselves. As a result, we got a better understanding of the weaknesses, strengths of these security mechanisms, and the challenges of WLAN security management. 

- [**WPS: A user configuration facility that became a threat**](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}/wireless-network-security/blob/master/essay/ttm4137_essay.pdf) - Essay submitted to Wireless Network Security (TTM4137) during my semester at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. The essay firstly provides the necessary background knowledge about the Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS), then it focuses on why it became a security threat and how does a brute-force attack take advantage of it. Finally, it briefly describes what safety measures can be carried out for preventing this attack.
