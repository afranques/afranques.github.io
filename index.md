Hi, I am **Antonio Franques**, PhD student in Computer Science at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](http://illinois.edu).

I am a member of the [i-acoma](http://iacoma.cs.uiuc.edu/) group, led by [Prof. Josep Torrellas](http://iacoma.cs.uiuc.edu/josep/torrellas.html). My research focuses on the application of extremely high frequency wireless on-chip communications in massive multi-core architectures. The research spans a gamut of topics related to computer architecture, like cache coherence protocols and fine-grain synchronization, but also aims for an energy and area efficient use of the wireless communications devices involved.<br clear="left" />

I graduated from [Polytechnic University of Valencia (UPV)](http://www.upv.es/index-en.html) in 2015 with a bachelor's degree in Telecommunications Engineering. My undergraduate thesis, titled "Numerical Methods for Nonlinear Modeling", awarded with a Distinction (highest grade with honors) by the [School of Telecommunications Engineering](https://www.etsit.upv.es/), was the product of almost two years of research in the area of Computational Mathematics under the supervision of Professors Juan Ramon Torregrosa and Alicia Cordero, which also led to 3 journal publications and 2 conference papers.

Although I am currently living in [Champaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champaign%E2%80%93Urbana_metropolitan_area), Illinois (USA), I am originally from [l'Espluga de Francoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Espluga_de_Francol%C3%AD) (Spain)&mdash;a beautiful little town where I spent most part of my childhood. In the past, I have also lived in [Trondheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trondheim) (Norway)&mdash;where I completed the last year of my undergraduate studies at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology&mdash;as well as in [Valencia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valencia)(Spain)&mdash;where I obtained my Telecommunications Engineering degree at the Polytechnic University of Valencia&mdash;and [Barcelona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona) (Spain)&mdash;where I spent a couple of years at La Salle Gracia, taking a series of technical courses in Computer Science to prepare for college.
