Hi, I am **Antonio Franques**, PhD student in Computer Science at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](http://illinois.edu).

I am a member of the [i-acoma](http://iacoma.cs.uiuc.edu/) group, led by [Prof. Josep Torrellas](http://iacoma.cs.uiuc.edu/josep/torrellas.html). My research focuses on the application of extremely high frequency wireless NoC in massive multi-core architectures. The research spans a gamut of topics related to computer-architecture, like cache coherence protocols and on-chip networks, but also aims for an energy and area efficient use of the wireless communications devices involved.<br clear="left" />

I graduated from [Polytechnic University of Valencia (UPV)](http://www.upv.es/index-en.html) in 2015 with a bachelor's degree in Telecommunications Engineering. My undergraduate thesis, titled "Numerical methods for nonlinear modeling", awarded with a Distinction (highest grade with honors) by the [School of Telecommunications Engineering](https://www.etsit.upv.es/), was the product of almost two years of research in the area of Computational Mathematics under the supervision of Professors Juan Ramon Torregrosa and Alicia Cordero, which also led to 3 journal publications and 2 conference papers.

I am currently living in [Urbana-Champaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champaign%E2%80%93Urbana_metropolitan_area), Illinois. In the past, I have lived in [Trondheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trondheim) (Norway), as well as in [Valencia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valencia), [Barcelona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona), and l'[Espluga de Francoli](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espluga_de_Francol%C3%AD) (Spain), this last being the place where I spent most part of my childhood.
