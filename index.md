Hi, I am Antonio Franques, PhD student in Computer Science at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](http://illinois.edu).

I am a member of the [i-acoma](http://iacoma.cs.uiuc.edu/) group, led by [Prof. Josep Torrellas](http://iacoma.cs.uiuc.edu/josep/torrellas.html). My research focuses on the application of high-frequency wireless on-chip communication in manycore architectures. Specifically, my goal is to design new shared-memory architectures that reduce the large cost of core-to-core communications in parallel computing <br clear="left" />

In 2015 I received my Bachelor's Degree in Telecommunications Engineering from [Polytechnic University of Valencia (UPV)](http://www.upv.es/index-en.html). During my undegradate studies, I also performed almost two years of research in the area of Computational Mathematics under the supervision of Professors Juan Ramon Torregrosa and Alicia Cordero. 

Although I am currently living in [Champaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champaign%E2%80%93Urbana_metropolitan_area), Illinois (USA), I am originally from [l'Espluga de Francoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Espluga_de_Francol%C3%AD) (Spain)&mdash;a beautiful little town where I spent most of my childhood. In the past, I have also lived in [Trondheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trondheim) (Norway)&mdash;where I completed the last year of my undergraduate studies at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology&mdash;as well as in [Valencia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valencia) (Spain).

Besides Computer Science related topics, my other personal interests include cooking, running/hiking, rock climbing and travelling.
